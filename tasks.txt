Traveling Salesman

Implement a solution for the following traveling salesman problem:
The salesman has to visit following five cities for the provided duration of working days, in any order
Karachi (4 days)
Lahore (3 days)
Islamabad (3 days)
Quetta (2 days)
Peshawar (5 days)
Hotel rates in the cities are:
Karachi Rs. 10,000/-
Lahore Rs. 9,000/-
Islamabad Rs. 15,000/-
Quetta 7,000/-
Peshawar 8,000/-
The flights he can take are as under (either way):
Karachi - Islamabad, Morning and Evening 7 days a week, Rs. 18,000/-
Karachi - Lahore, Morning and Evening 5 working days a week Rs. 14,000/-
Lahore - Peshawar, Evening only Tuesday and Thursday, Rs. 12,000/-
Islamabad - Quetta, Morning only 5 working days, Rs. 10,000/-
Karachi - Quetta, Evening only Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, Rs. 11,000/-
Implement a software which computes a solution to get the salesman to all cities for the required number of working days in the minimum possible of total days and spending minimum amount for traveling and lodging. Assume that morning flights get him to a new city at start of business day and evening flights leave after end of business day. Hotel are charges are per night and charged in the city where they are or reach by evening flight. Flights are on the same time so can not take two evening or morning flights on the same day.
